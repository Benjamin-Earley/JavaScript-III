/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Binding: Unless provided with an object to reference, 'this' will simply refer to the window/console object in its entirety.
* 2. Implicit Binding: When calling a function with 'obj.function()' syntax, 'this' will refer to 'obj'.
* 3. New Binding: When creating a constructor, 'this' refers to every time the object is constructed and returned with new input.
* 4. Explicit Binding: 'this' is difined within a function which uses 'call' and 'apply' or when invoking a function with 'call' and 'apply' while referring to specific objects to be returned.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
